# github-user-activity
I took this idea from [github-user-activity](https://roadmap.sh/projects/github-user-activity), a challenge from [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/).

This script fetches the latest events for a given GitHub username and prints them.

## How to run

Clone the repository and run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/babyadolf/github-user-activity.git
cd github-user-activity
```

Run the following commands:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 main.py <username>
```

And yeah that's pretty much it..
